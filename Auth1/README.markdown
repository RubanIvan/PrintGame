# Simple MVC User Management 
Simple MVC User Management is a user management solution to quickstart your ASP.NET MVC project.

Widgets for managing users and roles are generated by a static html/js/css helper. These widgets can be included in any existing administration page and there is no need to create additional views or areas. 
One controller is included which provides the membership and role information. 

*Please note that this solution is ajax only and all membership and role information is rendered on the client through javascript.*

**Latest Version:** 0.1.1

##Features:
- Paged user list by using mottie's tablsorter fork and pager plugin (included in MyHtmlHelper)
- Create / delete user accounts
- Create / delete roles
- Manage roles for users
- Client-side success and error messages 
- Custom user authorization possible
- Any membership or roleprovider can be used

##Dependencies
- >= jQuery 1.7
- ASP.NET MVC2 or 3
 
## Demo
You can watch a demo of the latest development version at [http://usermanagementdemo.apphb.com](http://usermanagementdemo.apphb.com "http://usermanagementdemo.apphb.com").  
(The providers used for the demo are incomplete dummies, so you won't see the real membership provider behavior in all cases.

## How to use in your project

        // your routes 
	    // ...
    }


	 protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest()
    {
      // check if the user management controller is the target controller for this request
      if (UserManagementController.IsTargeted())
      {
        // Do any custom authorization checks here (e.g. Roles.IsUserInRole("Admin")) 
        UserManagementController.IsRequestAuthorized = true;
